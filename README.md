# Custom error pages for Traefik (rewrited with Hugo)

## Motivation

As [original project](https://github.com/guillaumebriday/traefik-custom-error-pages) is deprecated and not maintenable (I wanted to build it and Ruby dependancies throw an error), I decided to carry the project with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) :)

## Getting started

docker run -d -p 8000:80 tchoupinax/traefik-custom-error-pages

## Development

You have to [install](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) hugo on your environment.

For development and watching changes

```
hugo serve -w
```

For building 

```
hugo
```

## How to use with Traefik
